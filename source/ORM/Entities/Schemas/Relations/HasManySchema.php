 * Declares simple has many relation. Relations like that used when parent record has many child

 * fields.
 *
 * Example, [User has many Comments], user primary key is "id":
 * - relation will create outer key "user_id" in "comments" table (or other table name), nullable
 *   by default
 * - relation will create index on column "user_id" in "comments" table if allowed
 * - relation will create foreign key "comments"."user_id" => "users"."id" if allowed
