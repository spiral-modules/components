/**
 * Has one is just one of the cases of HasMany. Relations like that used when parent record has one
 * child with [outer] key linked to value of [inner] key of parent mode.
 *
 * HasOne is identical to HasMany but uses different loader.
 *
 * Relation is not nullable by default (!).
 *
 * Example, [User has one Profile], user primary key is "id":
 * - relation will create outer key "user_id" in "profiles" table (or other table name), nullable
 *   by default
 * - relation will create index on column "user_id" in "profiles" table if allowed
 * - relation will create foreign key "profiles"."user_id" => "users"."id" if allowed
